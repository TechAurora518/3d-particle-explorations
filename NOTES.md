#### WORKING

- [ ] finish animation parts of other demos, that's most important
- [ ] setup replay loader button
- [ ] responsive content working on mobile (seeing background color, width with scrollbars)
- [ ] auto count down of loader?
- [ ] document code
- [ ] add 3d rotations and force perspective more to drive 3d feel more
- [ ] make load times longer to show animation more
- [ ] shit is still showing when I go to replay...

#### THEMES

- [x] #1 - ring spin
- [x] #2 - simplex noise line
- [x] #3 - bubble separator
- [x] #4 - double helix
- [x] #5 - ***
- [x] #6 - spinning orbitals
- [x] #7 - ***
- [x] #8 - ***

- [ ] ripple
- [ ] grid
- [ ] chaos/noise
- [ ] accelerator
- [ ] eclipse
- [ ] starfield
- [ ] planets orbiting (space)
- [ ] wanderers
- [ ] game of life
- [ ] HITS of simplex noise (actual noise), then settle back down to zero
- [ ] audio levels / equalizer
- [ ] exploded noise in x, y, z space (like white particles on black demo)

10x10 grid with lines going through it in a burst almost electrical looking

use more performant buffer shit?

#### EXITS

- zoom in to single particle
- all particle grow to fill screen
- gravity drop, then content comes from top
- bubble up, then content comes from bottom
- ease left, then content come from right
- ease right, then content come from left

#### MISC

- [ ] test on mobile
- [ ] test on browsers
- [ ] handle viewport width changes, getting cut off now, how can we maintain this?
- [ ] handle unfocused tab and timing
- [ ] handle memory clean up and stopping
- [ ] lines are flashing on demo 4, double helix, get stacking order correct
- [ ] entrance animation scale
- [ ] weird issue on replay, sometimes ends fast
