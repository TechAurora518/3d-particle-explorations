#### WORKING

- [ ] document code
- [ ] add 3d rotations and force perspective more to drive 3d feel more
- [ ] make load times longer to show animation more
- [ ] shit is still showing when I go to replay...
- [ ] preload images for #8
- [ ] refactor and clean up for #8

#### THEMES

- [x] #1 - ring spin
- [x] #2 - simplex noise line
- [x] #3 - bubble separator
- [x] #4 - double helix
- [ ] #5 - grid
- [x] #6 - spinning orbitals
- [ ] #7 - ***
- [x] #8 - simplex noise flow

- [ ] ripple
- [ ] grid
- [ ] accelerator
- [ ] eclipse
- [ ] starfield
- [ ] planets orbiting (space)
- [ ] wanderers
- [ ] audio levels / equalizer
- [ ] 10x10 grid with lines going through it in a burst almost electrical looking


grid simplex wave
grid with line jolts going through

#### EXITS

- zoom in to single particle
- all particle grow to fill screen
- gravity drop, then content comes from top
- bubble up, then content comes from bottom
- ease left, then content come from right
- ease right, then content come from left

#### MISC

- [ ] test on mobile
- [ ] test on browsers
- [ ] handle viewport width changes, getting cut off now, how can we maintain this?
- [ ] handle unfocused tab and timing
- [ ] handle memory clean up and stopping
- [ ] lines are flashing on demo 4, double helix, get stacking order correct
