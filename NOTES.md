#### THEMES

- [x] bubbles
- [ ] ripple
- [ ] spiral
- [ ] grid
- [ ] chaos
- [ ] accelerator
- [ ] metaballs
- [ ] eclipse
- [ ] star trails
- [ ] starfield
- [ ] planets orbiting (space)
- [ ] spiral
- [ ] wanderers
- [ ] game of life
- [ ] simplex noise
- [x] double helix
- [x] simplex noise line across center
- [ ] HITS of simplex noise (actual noise), then settle back down to zero

#### EXITS

- zoom in to single particle
- all particle grow to fill screen
- gravity drop, then content comes from top
- bubble up, then content comes from bottom
- ease left, then content come from right
- ease right, then content come from left

#### MISC

- [ ] make sure noise is scaled based on width for the simplex noise demo, doesn't look the same on diff widths
- [ ] exploded noise in x, y, z space (like white particles on black demo)
- [ ] test on mobile
- [ ] test on browsers
- [ ] handle viewport width changes, getting cut off now, how can we maintain this?
- [ ] test 1 fill/complete method
- [ ] test usage of lines
- [ ] should I use dtn or not alongslide mainloop?
- [ ] handle unfocused tab and timing.
